# Compiler Aliasing Fear

Pointer aliasing forces compilers to avoid optimizing code as best as they should. We use local variables to fix this problem.

For all examples shown below, assume `context` is a pointer to a heap allocated
struct.

## Rule 1: Scalars and Arrays inside a loop

If booleans, integers, or arrays gets modified inside a loop, always assign them to
local variables before doing so. Yes there are other ways to make the compiler
optimize this specific scenario, but we do this to guarantee speed.

```c
// SLOW
//
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Forces a write to memory 100 times.
    //
    context->counter++;

    // This stopped context->counter from being kept in a CPU Register..
    //
    // The compiler doesnt know what do_something() does. It might write to
    // context->counter. 
    // 
    // The compiler is forced to:
    //
    // 1. Save `counter` from register to RAM.
    // 2. Calls do_something().
    // 3. Reloads `counter` fron ram to register.
    //
    do_something(context)

}
```

### Register Only Approach

```c
// FASTEST

// Load from memory to register once.
//
uint32_t count = context->counter;

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Modify register directly. Zero memory access here.
    //
    count++; 

    // Pass the register value to the helper. We pass 'count' directly to avoid
    // the memory store.
    //
    do_something(context, count);
}

// Store from register back to memory once.
// 
context->counter = count;
```

### Hybrid Aprpoach (Optimized Load, Forced Store)

We do this if we cannot change the function signature.

```c
// FAST

uint32_t count = context->counter;

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    count++; 

    // We must sync memory because do_something() reads it. This costs us 1 
    // STORE per loop, but we still save the LOAD.
    // 
    context->counter = count;

    do_something(context);
}

// No final store needed, we kept it in sync the whole time.
```
